	doi = {10.1109/MMAR.2016.7575303},
	abstract = {A novel, homogeneous and continuous analytical model of cyclist pedaling torque angular distribution is presented in the article. The model is dedicated for use in an unique pedaling-by-wire system. The motivation to the research is to obtain a model for use in control system with compensation. Applying nonlinear compensation of cyclist load torque results in pedals speed ripples reduction - particularly noticeable at high torque loads. Theoretical assumptions to the model are described in the article with use of kinematics relations marked both on vehicle photography and detailed sketches. Inverse kinematics formulas are verified by comparison two different methods of formulating the kinematic equations of the model. Those methods bases on geometric and vector approach are different in computation complexity. The model of dynamics is presented with its physical fundamentals explanation. Adaptation system of presented model parameters is introduced basing on the Gauss-Newton algorithm. Fitting process is described on the example of three experimental reference data acquired at three different torque loads. Final results of parameters adaptation are presented in the graphical and numerical way by using chi2 coefficient. Further research plans based on obtained results are included in the article summary section.},

	abstract = {The synthesis of fuzzy logic classifier in burglary detector application is presented in the article. The signal source for the system are micro electro-mechanical (MEMS) devices: accelerometer and gyroscope. The use of selected MEMS ICs made the application compact and self-contained. Vibrations and rotational speed signals of protected surface are acquired and processed in computational core of classifier to detect critical events such as intrusion or attempt of it. Preliminary algorithms called direct-DSP transformation into fuzzy logic system is shown. The goal and the motivation of the work is to obtain more general results and better systematization of classifier activity. Fuzzy logic gave possibility of easier sensitivity tuning by changing rules or parameters of membership functions. FL classifier is also a step to create ANFIS structure, where membership functions parameters may be adopted in automated learning procedure. Hardware in general is described. The algorithm synthesis based on the fuzzy logic fundamentals is introduced together with its components such a: linguistic variables, its membership functions sets selection and fuzzy rules. The results are obtained on dedicated laboratory stand, evaluated and combined with existing results.},

	abstract = {Blade Tip Timing (BTT) is a non-intrusive method to measure blade vibration in turbomachinery. Time of Arrival (TOA) is recorded when a blade is passing a stationary sensor. The measurement data, in form of undersampled (aliased) tip-deflection signal, are difficult to analyze with standard signal processing methods like digital filters or Fourier Transform. Several indirect methods are applied to process TOA sequences, such as reconstruction of aliased spectrum and Least-Squares Fitting to harmonic oscillator model. We used standard sine fitting algorithms provided by IEEE-STD-1057 to estimate blade vibration parameters. Blade-tip displacement was simulated in time domain using SDOF model, sampled by stationary sensors and then processed by the sinefit.m toolkit. We evaluated several configurations of different sensor placement, noise level and number of data. Results of the linear sine fitting, performed with the frequency known a priori, were compared with the non-linear ones. Some of non-linear iterations were not convergent. The algorithms and testing results are aimed to be used in analysis of asynchronous blade vibration.},

observations. The fit is obtained as an approximate minimizer of the sum of squared errors, i.e., the difference between observations and model output. The contributions of this paper include a comparison of the performance of the four-parameter algorithm in the standard with the Cramer-Rao lower bound on accuracy, and with the performance of a nonlinear least squares approach. It is shown that the algorithm of IEEE-STD-1057 provides accurate estimates for Gaussian and quantization noise. In the Gaussian scenario it provides estimates with performance close to the derived lower bound. In severe conditions with noisy data covering only a fraction of a period, however, it is shown to have inferior performance compared with a one-dimensional search of a
concentrated cost function},
